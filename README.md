This project is based on: Nodejs, npm and the Meteor platform. https://www.meteor.com/
Other components (like GNU Radio, Wireshark and GR-GSM) have to be installed in order to use SDR-Detector. It's also possible to expand the system with detectors for **WiFi, Bluetooth, UMTS and LTE frequency bands**. (using existing open source projects)

**The software is compatible with:**
[Stingwatch](https://github.com/marvinmarnold/stingwatch) (Cordova based Stingray (IMSI-Catcher) detection) 
[Meteor ICC](https://github.com/marvinmarnold/meteor-imsi-catcher-catcher) Meteor-imsi-catcher-catcher (Meteor package for client + server side IMSI-catcher detection.) 
[API Client](https://github.com/marvinmarnold/StingrayAPIClient) (more details soon)
